# Detecting-MetabolicSyndrome-using-GA-ELM
This project uses OS-ELM for detecting metabolic syndrome and Hyperparameter tuning using Genetic Algorithm.

This project is implemented on google colab notebook and you have to take care of the second cell alone where the path of the drive is given 
if you want to run it locally you only have to comment the Cell No.1 and Cell No.2
